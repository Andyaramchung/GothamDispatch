This is a project for Columbia SIPA and the Brown Institute for Media Innovation.

To run the code, download the three main files and place them in the Desktop. Open a terminal, navigate to the Desktop, and then run "python GDSitemapScraperv8.py" to begin. THEN, run "python AuthorTextScraperv2.py". The files should then be downloaded and ready to use. 

Shoot me an email at andrew.chung@columbia.edu if you need help.
